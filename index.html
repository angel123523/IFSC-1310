    <h2> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement.</h2>
      <p>Progressive Enhancement is the method of site building that focuses on content that can be accessed by any browser. Compared to the Graceful degradation focuses on building websites that are optimized for the newest web browsers. </p>
    <p>
      I believe that Progressive Enhancement is important because it allows website makers to focus on their content. It also allows for your content to be accessible to an even larger audience as it will be optimized for most web browsers.

    <h2> Learning experience.</h2>
     <p>The micro-site project has been a fun challenge over the last couple of weeks. The process of building my site and watching how it developed has been very satisfying. This project has helped me become better at the web development process through trial and error. Whenever I had trouble with something during the website-building process, it forced me to rewatch the lecture recording to find the solution. </p>
     <p>Before this class, I never had much experience with HTML, CCS, or JavaScript. This class was a great introduction to these systems. If I could do anything differently in this class, I would try to stop procrastinating when working on the assignments.</p>
     <p>For this project, I gave two different friends my website link and asked for their feedback. Both of these friends had similar complaints about my website. According to their feedback, their critiques came mainly from the home page of the website. On the homepage, there was a section that contained photos and information about the SpaceX Dragons crew cabin, onboard lab, and cargo hold. To fix this critique, I added a slideshow-like feature to this section to make it look nicer. The second critique came from a low-quality background image of the dragon capsule in space. To fix this, I removed the image and replaced it with a black background.
